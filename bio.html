	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Kenneth Slaby. I grew up in Saint Petersburg, Florida. I am a member of the Tufts University class of 2018 and am majoring in computer science. I was not exposed to computer programming until I started college, but so far have enjoyed every minute of what I've learned.

	<p>
		I am the youngest of five, and the second computer programmer out of my siblings. However my siblings are much older than me, and for that reason I was not exposed to computer programming as I was growing up.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have a dog named Sunflower who is currently 10 years old. I enjoy sailing, videogames and hanging out with friends in my free time. I've always dreamed of traveling to Japan and seeing Tokyo, but otherwise have traveled extensively to South America and to Spain and Italy.
