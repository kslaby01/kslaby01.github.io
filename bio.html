<h1>bio</h1>
<p>
My name is Kenneth Slaby. I grew up in Saint Petersburg, Florida. I am a member of the Tufts University class of 2018 and a computer science major. I was not exposed to computer programming until I started college, but so far have enjoyed every minute of what I've learned.<br>
I am the youngest of five, and the second computer programmer out of my siblings. However my siblings are much older than me, which is why I wasn't exposed much to computer programming as I was growing up.<br>
I have a dog named Sunflower who is currently 10 years old. I enjoy sailing and videogames in my free time. I've always dreamed of traveling to Japan and seeing Tokyo.
